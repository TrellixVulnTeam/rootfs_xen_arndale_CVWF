Tag: systemd-service-file-outside-lib
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: The package ships a systemd service file outside
 <tt>/lib/systemd/system/</tt>
 .
 System administrators should have the possibility to overwrite a
 service file (or parts of it, in newer systemd versions) by placing a
 file in <tt>/etc/systemd/system</tt>, so the canonical location used
 for service files is <tt>/lib/systemd/system/</tt>.

Tag: systemd-tmpfiles.d-outside-usr-lib
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: The package ships a systemd tmpfiles.d(5) conf file outside
 <tt>/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/</tt>

Tag: systemd-service-file-refers-to-obsolete-target
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The systemd service file refers to an obsolete target.
 .
 Some targets are obsolete by now, e.g. syslog.target or dbus.target. For
 example, declaring <tt>After=syslog.target</tt> is unnecessary by now because
 syslog is socket-activated and will therefore be started when needed.

Tag: systemd-no-service-for-init-script
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: The listed init.d script has no systemd equivalent.
 .
 Systemd has a SysV init.d script compatibility mode. It provides access to
 each SysV init.d script as long as there is no native service file with the
 same name (e.g. <tt>/lib/systemd/system/rsyslog.service</tt> corresponds to
 <tt>/etc/init.d/rsyslog</tt>).
 .
 Your package ships a service file, but for the listed init.d script, there is
 no corresponding systemd service file.

Tag: init.d-script-does-not-source-init-functions
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The <tt>/etc/init.d</tt> script does not source
 <tt>/lib/lsb/init-functions</tt>. The <tt>systemd</tt> package provides
 <tt>/lib/lsb/init-functions.d/40-systemd</tt> to redirect
 <tt>/etc/init.d/$script</tt> calls to systemctl.
 .
 Please add a line like this to your <tt>/etc/init.d</tt> script:
 .
  . /lib/lsb/init-functions

Tag: maintainer-script-calls-systemctl
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Ref: https://wiki.debian.org/Systemd/Packaging
Info: The maintainer script calls systemctl directly. Actions such as enabling
 a unit file should be done using <tt>deb-systemd-helper</tt> so that they work
 on machines with or without systemd. Starting a service should be done via
 <tt>invoke-rc.d</tt>, if the service has a corresponding sysvinit script, or
 <tt>deb-systemd-invoke</tt> if it doesnâ€™t.
 .
 If you are using debhelper, please use the <tt>dh-systemd</tt> debhelper
 addon.
